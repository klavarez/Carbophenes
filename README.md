This project was overseen by Dr. Chad Junkermeier, and worked on in collaboration with Martin Adra and Valeria Aparicio Diaz.

There were four objectives to this project.
1. First, to evaluate the gas adsorption properties of carbophenes, specifically the adsorption energy, of pristine carbophenes. This was achieved by testing carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and hydrogen (H2) gasses.
2. To assess the adsorption energies of carbophines that have been functionalized with commonly occurring groups found in two-dimensional carbons. For example, carboxyl (COOH), amine (NH2), nitro (NO2), and hydroxyl (OH) groups.
3. To investigate how the presence of multiple functional groups within a single pore affects adsoeption energy.
4. To determine key material properties, such as molecular weight, melting temperature, and density.

Our results indicate that the adsorbtion energies of greenhouse gasses (GHGs) on functionalized carbophenes are higher than those of proposed next-generation adsorpents, while maintaining only half of their density. Adding a second GHG molecule does not significantly alter adsorption properties; however, increasing the density of functional groups within the carbophene pores can reduce the adsorption energy of GHGs. In addition, functionalized carbophenes have been demonstrated to adsorb hydrogen molecules with energies comparable to metal-containing materials. The predicted desorption temperatures are greater than 400 Kelvin, suggesting that carbophenes could be used as CO2 air scrubbers in confined spaces or as solid-state hydrogen storage materials.
